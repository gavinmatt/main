A small passion of mine outside of work is to start major projects with relatively little planning. Our recent 6 month saga of the backyard shed was no exception. In order to “save money” and “make things easier,” I decided that doing it entirely DIY with a kit and nothing else was the best way to go. Mistakes were made, lessons were learned…

It all started with an area. We live close to a mountain, and flat land comes at a premium. I (stupidly) decided to build it into a hill with retaining walls instead of using the very flat area on the opposite side of the yard. Despite having a skid steer available, we dug 90% of it by hand. It was all clay, and not just clay, but premium quality, dense, break your back clay. Clearing took weeks a few hours at a time
