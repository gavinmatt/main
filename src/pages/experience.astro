    Hello! I'm Gavin Matthews, a seasoned Product leader, professional writer, technical advocate, people manager, and habitual project starter located in Colorado Springs, Colorado! At work, I focus on developing highly engaged product teams that solve complex problems and build 0->1 products. I'm passionate about Product Led Growth, customer discovery, strong triad relationships with design and engineering, and truly knowing your product. At home, I'm drowning in dogs while taking on projects across home improvement, gardening, technology, and media preservation.
