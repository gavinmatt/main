        This data is captured from my home weather station and the National Weather Service! This is an
        experiment entirely using ChatGPT to create the components and pull data from
        Ambient Weather. I have very rough JS knowledge, so I want to see how far I can push it just using GPT-generated code and my own FE skills.
